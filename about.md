# About the n8n Creators Leaderboard

Welcome to the n8n Creators Leaderboard, a community-led initiative showcasing the top creators and their workflow templates.

## Our Purpose

This leaderboard aims to recognize the contributions of n8n creators, provide visibility to their templates, foster a spirit of healthy competition and collaboration within the community.

## Data Source and Statistics

The raw data for this leaderboard is [provided by n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/workflow-templates/#use-your-own-workflow-templates-library). We process this data to calculate the statistics and rankings displayed on this site. We regularly update this information to ensure accuracy and relevance. To ensure transparency and allow for community verification, both the latest and historical data are available in our [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}).

## Affiliate Disclosure

The website contains affiliate links. This means that, at no additional cost to you, we may earn a small commission if you click through and sign up for n8n cloud. Some creators may also receive bonuses through this affiliate program, further encouraging their participation. These commissions help incentivize creators to produce more high-quality workflow templates and contribute to the n8n community. Rest assured, this does not influence our rankings or evaluations.

## Monthly Challenges

We run monthly challenges to encourage both new and existing creators to contribute quality workflows to the n8n community. Here's how they work:

### Challenge Period and Eligibility
- Each challenge runs from the first to the last day of a month
- Eligible workflows include those created within a 2-month window:
  - From the first day of the month before the challenge
  - Until the last day of the challenge month
- For example, for the January 2025 challenge:
  - Challenge period: January 1-31, 2025
  - Eligible workflows: Created between December 1, 2024, and January 31, 2025

### Scoring and Rankings
- The primary metric for rankings is the number of workflow inserts (actual usage) rather than views
- For each creator, we sum the inserts of all their eligible workflows
- Creators are ranked based on their total inserts during the challenge period

This extended eligibility window serves two main purposes:
1. Encourages new participants to join the n8n community
2. Gives creators enough time to develop and refine quality workflows

## Community-Led Initiative

The n8n Creators Leaderboard is a community-led project. We strive to maintain transparency, fairness, and accuracy in our rankings and presentations. If you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for being part of the n8n creator community!
